Gamal was among the top three who reached the finals, but he ended up in second place. Despite his ending as a runner-up, he won the hearts of millions around the Arab world. Before Arab Idol, Gamal caught the attention of many big musicians such as Ammar El Sherei, Hany Mahanna, and Mohammed Elhelw.[6] Gamal likes both Eastern and Western music, especially Egyptian Folk music and House Music. Most of his songs are of his composition. Gamal was distinguished in Arab Idol with his deep strong sensitive voice, which one of the critics said: \"his voice is like a violin and doesn't need music while singing\".",
